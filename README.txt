Better Cats V0.09_1

All credit for the creation of this resourcepack goes to Mr Blue Yeti, the creator of BetterCats
The original download of this resourcepack can be found on Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/better-cats-minecraft

This resourcepack was edited by CodexCracked. It was changed so that the texture used on the cats would match their minecraft variant.
The edited files are in the Better_Cats_V0.09\assets\minecraft\optifine\mob\cat folder, with an unedited version existing in the Better_Cats_V0.09\assets\minecraft\mcpatcher\mob\cat folder.
I also got the ocelot variants working.
The pack.mcmeta file was tweaked to format this resourcepack for 1.20.4

Enjoy this fork, and have fun playing minecraft!
